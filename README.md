Swift Playground Alfred Workflow
================================

Create or open a Swift Playground through Alfred.

Install the workflow then open Alfred and type **swift** and press enter.  This will create a folder **~/Playgrounds/Default** and then open a playground named **default.playground** in XCode.  The next time you open Alfred and type **swift** this playground will be opened.

Alternatively you can pass in a parameter to **swift** and that playground will either be created if it doesn't already exist or opened if it does. e.g. **swift spriteKitTest**
